## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in&nbsp;O(n)&nbsp;time and without using the division operation.

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	2 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105
	-30 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 30
	The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


&nbsp;
Follow up:&nbsp;Can you solve the problem in O(1)&nbsp;extra&nbsp;space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
