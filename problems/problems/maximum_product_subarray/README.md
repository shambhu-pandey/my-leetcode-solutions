## 📖 Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
	-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
	The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## 💻 My Solution

```java
class Solution {
        public int maxProduct(int[] nums){
            int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int currentProduct = 1;

          // 1st pass
          for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.length; i++){
            currentProduct *=nums[i];
            ans = Math.max(ans, currentProduct);
            if(currentProduct==0){
                currentProduct=1;
            }
          }
          
          currentProduct=1;
        //   2nd pass
          for(int i = nums.length-1 ; i>=0;i--){
            currentProduct *=nums[i];
            ans = Math.max(ans, currentProduct);
            if(currentProduct==0){
                currentProduct=1;
            }
          }
           return ans;
        }
}
```
