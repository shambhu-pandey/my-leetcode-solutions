## Problem Description

Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1&#39;s present when written in binary.


	For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.


&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: left = 6, right = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6  -&gt; 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7  -&gt; 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
8  -&gt; 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
9  -&gt; 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
10 -&gt; 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.


Example 2:


Input: left = 10, right = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -&gt; 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -&gt; 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -&gt; 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -&gt; 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -&gt; 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -&gt; 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= left &lt;= right &lt;= 106
	0 &lt;= right - left &lt;= 104
