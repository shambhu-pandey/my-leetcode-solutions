## 📖 Problem Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s[i] is a printable ascii character.

    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left =0;
        int right = s.size()-1;

        while(left<right){
            swap(s[left] , s[right]);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
};
```
