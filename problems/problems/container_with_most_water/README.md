## 📖 Problem Description

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 
Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.


Example 2:


Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1


 
Constraints:


	n == height.length
	2 <= n <= 105
	0 <= height[i] <= 104

## 💻 My Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
       
       int i =0; 
       int j = height.size()-1;

      int maxarea =0;

       while(i<j){

        int h = min(height[i] , height[j]);
        int width = j-i;

        int area = h*width;
        //update area
        maxarea = max(area , maxarea);
       
       //move smaller height pointer
        if(height[i] < height[j]){
            i++;
        }
        else{
            j--;
        }
       }

       return maxarea;
    }
};
```
