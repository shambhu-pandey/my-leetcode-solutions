## 📖 Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.


	For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.


 
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 


Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.


Example 3:


Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
	1 <= Node.val <= 105

## 💻 My Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL){
            return NULL;
        }

        ListNode* temp = head;
        int count =0;

        while(temp!=NULL){
            count ++;
            temp= temp->next;
        } 

        int middle = count/2;
        temp = head;

        while(temp!=NULL){
            middle--;

            if(middle==0){
                ListNode* middleNode = temp->next;
                temp->next = temp->next->next;
                delete(middleNode);
                break;
            }
            temp = temp->next;
          }
        return head;
    }
};
```
