## 📖 Problem Description

You are given an m x n integer matrix grid.

We define an hourglass as a part of the matrix with the following form:

Return the maximum sum of the elements of an hourglass.

Note that an hourglass cannot be rotated and must be entirely contained within the matrix.

 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[6,2,1,3],[4,2,1,5],[9,2,8,7],[4,1,2,9]]
Output: 30
Explanation: The cells shown above represent the hourglass with the maximum sum: 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 30.


Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 35
Explanation: There is only one hourglass in the matrix, with the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35.


 
Constraints:


	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	3 <= m, n <= 150
	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106

## 💻 My Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int m = mat[0].length;
        if(n<3 || m<3){
            return -1;
        }
        int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
      

        for(int i = 0 ; i < n-2;i++){
            for(int j= 0; j < m-2;j++){
               int sum =mat[i][j] + mat[i][j+1] + mat[i][j+2] +mat[i+1][j+1]+ mat[i+2][j]+ mat[i+2][j+1]+mat[i+2][j+2];
                if(sum>ans){
                    ans= sum;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
