## Problem Description

You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:


	Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
	Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, &quot;346&quot; is replaced with &quot;13&quot; because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
	Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.


Return s after all rounds have been completed.

Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;11111222223&quot;, k = 3
Output: &quot;135&quot;
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: &quot;111&quot;, &quot;112&quot;, &quot;222&quot;, and &quot;23&quot;.
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
&nbsp; So, s becomes &quot;3&quot; + &quot;4&quot; + &quot;6&quot; + &quot;5&quot; = &quot;3465&quot; after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into &quot;346&quot; and &quot;5&quot;.
&nbsp; Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
&nbsp; So, s becomes &quot;13&quot; + &quot;5&quot; = &quot;135&quot; after second round. 
Now, s.length &lt;= k, so we return &quot;135&quot; as the answer.


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;00000000&quot;, k = 3
Output: &quot;000&quot;
Explanation: 
We divide s into &quot;000&quot;, &quot;000&quot;, and &quot;00&quot;.
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes &quot;0&quot; + &quot;0&quot; + &quot;0&quot; = &quot;000&quot;, whose length is equal to k, so we return &quot;000&quot;.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100
	2 &lt;= k &lt;= 100
	s consists of digits only.
