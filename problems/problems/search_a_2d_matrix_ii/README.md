## Problem Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:


	Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
	Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.


&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[i].length
	1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 300
	-109 &lt;= matrix[i][j] &lt;= 109
	All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
	All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
	-109 &lt;= target &lt;= 109
