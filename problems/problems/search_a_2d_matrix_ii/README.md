## 📖 Problem Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:


	Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
	Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.


 
Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false


 
Constraints:


	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[i].length
	1 <= n, m <= 300
	-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
	All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
	All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
	-109 <= target <= 109

## 💻 My Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        int column = matrix[0].size();

        int rowIndex = 0;   
        int columnIndex = column-1 ;

        while(rowIndex < row && columnIndex >=0 ){
            int element = matrix[rowIndex][columnIndex];

            if(element == target){
                return 1;
            }

            else if(element < target){
                rowIndex++;
            }
            else{
                columnIndex--;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
